(Beginner Level)

**Day 1 : Armstrong Number Finder** 

- Define a function that allows the user to check whether a given number is armstrong number or not.

- Hint: To do this, first determine the number of digits of the given number. Call that n. Then take every digit in the number and raise it to the nth power. Add them, and if your answer is the original number then it is an Armstrong number.

- Example: Take 1634. Four digits. So, 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634. So 1634 is an Armstrong number.


**Day 2 : Pythagorean Triples Checker** 

- Allows the user to input the sides of any triangle in any order.

- Return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.

- Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.


**Day 3 : Multiplication Table Generator**

- Generate and print the tables upto 50 values.

- Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.
